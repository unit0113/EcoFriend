# About
EcoFriend is a user-centric web application designed to promote sustainability. EcoFriend provides individuals who are concerned about environmental issues with a platform to initially assess their ecological impact, determine ecological issues most important to them, receive personalized task-based suggestions intended to foster ecological health, and learn about eco-friendly practices. Unlike conventional carbon calculators, EcoFriend fosters community engagement by allowing users to join their friends in completing ecological quests and earn digital tokens, badges, experience points, and other rewards for their efforts. EcoFriend empowers users to make a meaningful impact on their local environment while promoting a sense of belonging and shared responsibility. The platform features user authentication to ensure data security and enable personalization while encouraging active participation in maintaining the health of our environment.
